# Design
* [ ] Broken the problem down systematically into a series of smaller problems suitable for computational solutions, explaining and justifying the process.
  * Explain systamatic approach
    * [ ] Development approach?
    * Should explain traditional software design life cycle however using agile method for development. Justify
  * [ ] System diagram
* [ ] Defined in detail the structure of the solution to be developed.
* [ ] Described the solution fully using appropriate and accurate algorithms justifying how these algorithms form a complete solution to the problem.
* [ ] Described, justifying choices made, the usability features to be included in the solution.
  * [~] Proposed screen designs and usability features
    * Better analsysi of usability features e.g. shortcuts
* [ ] Identified and justified the key variables / data structures / classes (as appropriate to the proposed solution) justifying and explaining any necessary validation.
* [~] Detailed summary of process including key variables and structures
  * Explain validation?
  * TODO List key varibles, other key funcitons?
  * TODO explain how algorithms fit together
  * TODO for algorithsm do dry run testing to prove they work, how were the algos developed?
* [ ] Identified and justified the test data to be used during the iterative development of the solution.
  * Valid and invalid test data
  * NOT a full test plan
* [ ] Identified and justified any further data to be used in the post development phase
* [ ] Sign off
