# To do
## Views
* Name, Duration, Dependencies don't line up
* Project name has wierd box around it

## Models
* Duplicate events
* Crashes when no name or duration when adding activity

## Controllers


#Additions:
* New schedule button (sets interface to blank, not completely necessary as it can be achieved by restarting the program)
* Bolder/ larger text for activity name on schedule diagram
* Perhaps remove dotted lines on schedule diagram as they make things unclear
* When num of workers > minimum, tell the user that they don't need as many workers
